		<h1 class="aboutme-text-big"> About This Project</h1>
		<p class="aboutme-text">This is my demo website.  It is responsive to 3 breakpoints.  It was made with HTML and CSS in Sublime.  It uses an animated gradient background as you may have seen above and a non-animated gradient background behind my name at the top.  My name has a drop shadow of pink and there is both a light version and a dark version to this site because I couldn't decide</p>

		<span class="col-1">
			<p class="aboutme-text-1"> My name is Tage and I'm 14 years old.  I can use HTML and CSS (as you can hopefully see) and I want to learn JavaScript in the coming months.  Outside of coding, I like to play soccer and run.  I have also spent a lot of time in the "sneaker world" and enjoy that experience</p>
